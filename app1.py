Welcome to GETAROUND prediction API
GetAround is the Airbnb for cars. You can rent cars from any person for a few hours to a few days! Founded in 2009, this company has known rapid growth. In 2019, they count over 5 million users and about 20K available cars worldwide. 
GetAround is a company that allows car owners to rent their cars to customers.You just have to specify some informations about your car to make an approximation of what can be your rental price per day.
